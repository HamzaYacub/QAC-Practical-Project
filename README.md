## Introduction

The overall objective of this project was to create a service-orientated architecture consisting of at least 4 micro services that work together.

As I had full control over the topic of this project, I had decided to create a random vehicle and paint job generator that would give the user a special discount depending on the outcome of the vehicles and paint jobs.

The 4 micro services within this project are as follow:

* Service 1: Renders the Jinja2 templates based upon the outcome of service 4 as well as persisting the data in a SQL database
* Service 2: Generates random vehicle
* Service 3: Genrates random paintjob
* Service 4: Creates an object (discount) based upon the results of service 2 and 3 respectively.

### Additional Requirements

In addition to the objective, there were a minimum set of requirements which also had to have been met. These include:

* An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
  * This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
  * If a change is made to a code base, then Web hooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Micro Services architecture that has been asked for
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.

## Project Tracking

A [Trello][trello-link] board was used to organise this project of all of its respective requirements and tasks. This was done in accordance to the MoSCoW principles.

## Architecture

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

This was the initial design of the entity-relationship model which highlights the components and the relationships between the tables.

![ERD][erd-link]

However after careful consideration and a look at the requirements, it was clear that multiple tables were not necessary and therefore only 1 table was needed in order to persist all the required data.

![ERD2][erd2-link]

This updated ERD only shows the one table rather than the multiple tables I had before 

## Design

Here is the front end design for the application. As we were mainly focused on the backend and functionality of the project, the mark scheme does not go into any detail regarding the front end, only that it is functioning as it should. Therefore, only very basic CSS was used.
