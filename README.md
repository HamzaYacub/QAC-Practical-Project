## Introduction

The overall objective of this project was to create a service-orientated architecture consisting of at least 4 micro services that work together.

As I had full control over the topic of this project, I had decided to create a random vehicle and paint job generator that would give the user a special discount depending on the outcome of the vehicles and paint jobs.

The 4 micro services within this project are as follow:

* Service 1: Renders the Jinja2 templates based upon the outcome of service 4 as well as persisting the data in a SQL database
* Service 2: Generates random vehicle
* Service 3: Genrates random paintjob
* Service 4: Creates an object (discount) based upon the results of service 2 and 3 respectively.

### Additional Requirements

In addition to the objective, there were a minimum set of requirements which also had to have been met. These include:

* An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
  * This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
  * If a change is made to a code base, then Web hooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Micro Services architecture that has been asked for
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.

## Project Tracking

A [Trello][trello-link] board was used to organise this project of all of its respective requirements and tasks. This was done in accordance to the MoSCoW principles.

## Architecture

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

This was the initial design of the entity-relationship model which highlights the components and the relationships between the tables.

![ERD][erd-link]

However after careful consideration and a look at the requirements, it was clear that multiple tables were not necessary and therefore only 1 table was needed in order to persist all the required data.

![ERD2][erd2-link]

This updated ERD only shows the one table rather than the multiple tables I had before 

## Design

Here is the front end design for the application. As we were mainly focused on the backend and functionality of the project, the mark scheme does not go into any detail regarding the front end, only that it is functioning as it should. Therefore, only very basic CSS was used.

## Testing

Pytest, specifically Unit testing, has been used to test the code produced in this project. Selenium was planned to be used for Integration testing however it was not fully implemented and therefore not included at this time. Only the python files in the 4 services were tested since PyTest can only test python files. 

Here are the links to the coverage reports for each individual service:

* [Service 1][cov1]
* [Service 2][cov2]
* [Service 3][cov3]
* [Service 4][cov4]

### Analysis

Although a full coverage was met for all 4 services, I had some difficulty in reaching it. Services 1 - 3 were simple and only required 1 or 2 tests each to reach full coverage as they only had simple get requests. Service 4 on the other hand proved to be quite troublesome as along with the get requests, there was also a lot of logic depending on what got pulled from the get requests. Since the get requests pulled randomly from a CSV file, it was impossible to reach full coverage doing normal tests. I had initially attempted mocking but was unsuccessful in implementing it. In order to solve this problem, I had to make a small change to my routes.py. Instead of using the get requests from service 2 and 3, I included the them as parameters in the app.route function.

So instead of it being like this:

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def discount():
    
    vehicle = requests.get('http://service_2:5002').text
    paintjob = requests.get('http://service_3:5003').text
    v_discount = 0
    p_discount = 0
    total_discount = 0
    generous = False
    
I rewrote it as:

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def discount(vehicle, paintjob, generous):
    
    #vehicle = requests.get('http://service_2:5002').text
    #paintjob = requests.get('http://service_3:5003').text
    v_discount = 0
    p_discount = 0
    total_discount = 0
    #generous = False
    
Doing this allowed me to check that every vehicle and paintjob was being correctly incorporated as well as checking my second implementation for service 4 - generous discounts.

## Improvements for future
