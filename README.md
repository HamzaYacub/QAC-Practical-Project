## Introduction

The overall objective of this project was to create a service-orientated architecture consisting of at least 4 micro services that work together. 

### Additional Requirements

In addition to the objective, there were a minimum set of requirements which also had to have been met. These include:

* An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
  * This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
  * If a change is made to a code base, then Web hooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Micro Services architecture that has been asked for
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
